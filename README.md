## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qt-music-player.git
   cd qt-music-player
   ```

2. Configure MPD:
   - Edit `/etc/mpd.conf` to set your `music_directory` and `audio_output`.
   - Example:
     ```
     music_directory    "~/Music"
     audio_output {
         type            "pulse"
         name            "PulseAudio Output"
     }
     ```

3. Build the application using Qt:
   - Open `make.pro` in Qt Creator
   - Or build via terminal:
     ```bash
     qmake make.pro
     make
     ./MusicPlayer
     ```
